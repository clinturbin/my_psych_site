        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <section>
            <article class="show_info">
                <p><strong>PSYCH</strong> is a quick-witted dramedy about a young police consultant Shawn Spencer (James Roday, “The Dukes of Hazzard”) 
                    who solves crimes with powers of observation so acute that Santa Barbara PD detectives think he's psychic.</p>
                <p>Psych also stars Dule Hill (“The West Wing”) as Shawn's best friend and reluctant sidekick, Gus, and Corbin Bernsen 
                    (“L.A. Law”) as his disapproving father, Henry, who ironically was the one who honed his son's "observation" skills as a child.  
                    Also featured are Timothy Omundson (“Judging Amy”), Maggie Lawson (“Two and a Half Men”) and Kirsten Nelson (“War of the Worlds”).</p>
                <p>Psych was created by Steve Franks ("Big Daddy"), who also serves as executive producer, along with Chris Henze and Kelly Kulchack, 
                    in association with Tagline Television and NBC Universal Television Studios. Co-executive producers include Saladin Patterson ("Frasier") 
                    and Josh Bycel ("American Dad"). Serving as producers are Andy Berman, Anupam Nigam and Kell Cahoon. Tim Meltreger is staff writer.</p>
